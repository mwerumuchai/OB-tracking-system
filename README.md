## Description
This is an integrated Occurrence Book application system that captures and manages all activities in a police station where manual occurrence books and registers are used.

Occurences such as reporting a crime, cash bail payment and booking a suspect are logged electronically by the officers on duty.The system interfaces with users on all levels and has an according set of rules to guide the user through mandatory fields to correctly capture occurrence data. This process ensures the integrity of the data and also speeds up capturing of information and at the same time enforces standardisation.

The system is web based and makes use of a centralised database to store all system information.The system is designed to be user friendly and easy to use.

System security is achieved using usernames and passwords linked to specific roles and rights as well as built-in database security mechanisms. To further extend the systemâ€™s security options, it can be set up to run securely using encryption.
